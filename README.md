# Abstract:
This work is a research of the hidden space in image transformation neural networks. The main goal of this experiment is a model that transforms similar images into the same hidden vectors (for example, the first N components must be the same).

# Instructions to start:
All instructions are in the .ipynb file. Just run the cells and it will tell you what they do in front of them.

# References:
The main model has taken from [this github](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE)
